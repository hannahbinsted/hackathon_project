# netflix_project

This is a group project aiming to analyse a dataset of Netflix titles, in order to give reccomendations to a fictional new streaming service.

The data was first cleaned, with dates changed to datetime format, missing data checked, and duplicates removed. Then some exploratory data analysis was carried out.
