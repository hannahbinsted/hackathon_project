# netflix_project

This is a group project aiming to analyse a dataset of Netflix titles, in order to give reccomendations to a fictional new streaming service.

The data can be found in netflix_titles.csv. The first stage was to clean this data, with dates changed to datetime format, missing data checked, and duplicates removed. Then some exploratory data analysis was carried out - see file group_netflix_project.

In order to render the graphs as they are in Jupter Notebooks, please follow this link: https://nbviewer.org/github/hannahbinsted/hackathon_project/blob/main/group_netflix_project.ipynb
